# PalringoAPI for .net standard 2.0
A complete rewrite of the original [PalringoAPI](https://github.com/calico-crusade/PalringoApi) in .net standard 2.0

# Where can I use it?
I have tested it on Windows (.net Framework 4.5.1+ & Core 2.0) and on Mac (Core 2.0). Anyone want to test on linux for me? ;)

# How do I use it?
It is pretty simple to use. You can install it via Nuget (see below). There are 2 different packages available.

```
PM> Install-Package PalApi
```
The primary package that contains all of the useful stuff. Networking, Plugins, all of it. 

```
PM> Install-Package PalApi.Storage
```
This package is an extra-addon that is like a mini version of EntityFramework but with my own spin on it. Mostly because I was bored one day.
